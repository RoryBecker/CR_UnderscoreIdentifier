# 'Underscore Identifier' for CodeRush #

### Purpose ###
This Coderush Plugin provides a new Refactoring called '**Underscore Identifier**'

### Availability ###
Availability depends on the caret being placed on an identifier whose name does not contain an underscore.

When activated, the identifier is renamed (using CodeRush's own Rename Refactoring) such that all uppercase characters are preceeded by an underscore character.  

### Usage ###
Simply place your caret on an identifier whose name does not contain an underscore and trigger via the 'Underscore Identifier' on the CodeRush SmartTag menu.
